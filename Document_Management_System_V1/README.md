 DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Abstract
In the digital age, the management and processing of documents have become critical tasks for businesses and organizations seeking to maintain efficiency and accuracy in their operations. The Document Management System (DMS) we propose leverages advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to automate the transcription and indexing of document contents, significantly enhancing the capabilities of traditional DMS solutions.

Our system is designed to streamline the document handling process by automatically recognizing and extracting text from scanned documents, images, and PDFs. This extracted data is then transcribed and organized into searchable formats, enabling users to quickly retrieve and utilize information without manual data entry. The DMS supports a wide range of document types and languages, making it a versatile tool for various industries.

Key features of the DMS include:
Automated OCR Processing: Utilizes state-of-the-art OCR algorithms to accurately convert different types of documents into editable and searchable text.
Intelligent Transcription: Transcribes recognized text and categorizes it based on predefined templates or user-defined criteria, facilitating easy document management and retrieval.
Enhanced Searchability: Offers robust search functionalities that allow users to find documents based on content, keywords, or metadata.

Integration Capabilities: Seamlessly integrates with existing enterprise systems, databases, and workflows to ensure smooth adoption and interoperability.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive and accessible user interface that simplifies the process of uploading, processing, and managing documents.
The implementation of this DMS with integrated OCR and transcription capabilities not only reduces the time and effort required for document processing but also improves data accuracy and accessibility. This system is poised to be an invaluable asset for organizations looking to optimize their document management practices and enhance their operational efficiency.




Install instructions
Step-by-Step Instructions
Clone the Repository:

First, clone the Git repository to your local machine. Replace your-repo-url with the actual URL of your Git repository.


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-url.git
cd your-repo-url
Navigate to Frontend and Backend Directories:

The project has separate directories for frontend (Clientside) and backend (ServerSide). Navigate to each directory and install the dependencies.

Install Frontend Dependencies:

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies using npm or yarn. Replace frontend-directory with the actual path to your frontend directory.


cd frontend-directory
npm install

Start the Frontend Development Server:

After installing the dependencies, start the frontend development server. This is typically done with:


ng serve
The frontend server usually runs on a port like http://localhost:4200.

Install Backend Dependencies:

Open a new terminal window or tab. Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies. Replace backend-directory with the actual path to your backend directory.

Install JDK 17/19/21/22


 Wait for the IDE to index the libraries

Start the Backend Server:

After installing the dependencies, start the backend server. This is typically done  by runnng the main class.


Troubleshooting
Port Conflicts: Ensure the frontend and backend servers are running on different ports.
Dependencies: Make sure you have all necessary global dependencies installed (e.g., Node.js, npm, yarn).
Environment Variables: Double-check your environment variables and configuration settings
By following these instructions, you should be able to set up both the frontend and backend of your project from a Git repository. If your project has additional setup steps, refer to the projectâ€™s documentation for more details.
